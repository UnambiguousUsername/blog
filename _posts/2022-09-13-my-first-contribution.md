What an exciting day!

I figured out that the error that I was running in to was due to non-matching case for a variable and how it was named in the config.json file.

While reading through the Discord.js guide, I saw a place where I could make a small change.
So I forked the repo, cloned it, made my 2 very miniscule changes, pushed, and then made a pull request!
Now to wait and see if it gets merged.
I am a little worried though, it says that there have been changes to files that I did not touch, like updates or new files. Hopefully those repo editors know how to navigate better than I.

So now I've finished the Creating Your Bot section of the guide. Next is the Interactions section!
