It lives!

I got a tiny start on a blog post that I'm following in order to eventually run my Discord Bot on Docker.
https://blog.iamdavidfrancis.com/posts/discord-bot/

Side note: I should learn and test the capabilities of GitHub Pages (what this blog is built on) to see what formatting and other magics can be performed.

My overall goal following this blog isn't just to start a Discord bot. I also want to learn more technologies so that I appear more valuable to "employers".
The list so far that it looks like I'll be learning through this is: GitHub, GitKraken, Typescript/Javascript, Docker, and Redis?
Git* and Redis just because I'm choosing to use those in this project.

I'm also going to commit to making at least 1 commit a day to hobart.
