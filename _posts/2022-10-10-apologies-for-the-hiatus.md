I have let myself slide a bit.

I've lacked on working on my Node.js bot and even doing any sort of update to this blog.

I've been on a job hunt for a bit now, as my current employer is cutting the IT department (me) due to sales being down.
So I'm trying to do what I can to apply to positions that sound like I could do?!?!

All I feel that I can be confident in is some experience with SQL, Excel VBA, and some Python.
I really feel that I could learn whatever is thrown at me, but like, how do you pitch that to a prospective employer?
They have a shopping list, and there are more than likely going to have applicants who have at least touched most of the software they are requiring right?
I haven't even used a lot of extra frameworks or softwares or tools so I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle.
Both of my last positions were a lot of luck more or less due to networking, and I am terrible at networking and don't have an extensive circle.

While I inevitably am unemployed, I am really going to do my best to focus on some areas that are probably a lot more "realistic" for me to aim for.
Some sort of database administrator, ETL developer, or possibly data analysis.
So I will try to spend some future time with this bot, it definitely will not be a focus while I'm hoping and looking for a paycheck.

- Stay groovy
