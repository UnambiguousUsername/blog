Finished day 8 and I'm going to clock out after that.
I had assumed from part 1 that if a tree is shorter than the one I was just looking at, that it wouldn't count towards the scenic score.

Apparently that was a bad assumption. I was able to look at code a fellow professional wrote that was more my level and I saw that they were counting every tree.
