Wew buddy. I'm really cooking on the bot now.
In my efforts to try and understand and divine the meaning behind what the guide has for code, I've delved into the documentation to find out any limitations.
I'm getting a little bit smarter everyday.

I reworked the commands file structure. I came up with 3 groups, released, in development, and example commands.
Released will be available globally on my bot, while in development and examples will only be on my personal server.

I believe I found out that when you invoke a slash command, it can only have 1 subcommand, which I spent a while trying to figure out the answer to that.
There was no wording saying there could NOT be multiple subcommands used, but by the sheer lack of wording mentioning multiple subcommands, I have deduced that you only get one.

Many more examples to create, like of different menus and buttons. So hobart will not be publically released for a bit.
