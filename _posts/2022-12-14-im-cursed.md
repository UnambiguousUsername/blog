I'm going to set up a calendar notification so that I can make a habit of coming back to code/program/develop something everyday. Otherwise I'll continue to devote my time to other things.

Right now I need to play catch up on Advent of Code. A week behind or just about at this point.

I'm also going to update my personal page. I'm sure my goals have changed from whatever is on there, can't even remember the contents.

Progress! Slowly...
