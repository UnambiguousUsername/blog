I was able to focus today and make some progress!
I took some time while going through it to make sure I at least understood what was going on.

That being said, I hit a temporary wall in the guide as I'm getting in error in the 2nd part of deploying the Discord Bot commands.
I'll troubleshoot tomorrow. It seems I may just be passing parameters incorrectly to a function.

- Nice
