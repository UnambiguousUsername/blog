So I get to the literal next step in the blog and turns out it is using outdated Discord.js code.
Not a big deal at all since this bot is only a couple of files.

So now I'm following along with Discord.js official starting guide. I can refer back to the blog in order to host the bot with Docker.

That also means that I won't be learning Typescript for now!

- stay groovy
