Welp, I had plans to be productive.
I did not get around to that.

I'm tiny bit more familiar with GitKraken now. It really is some neat software.
I thought about trying to lump in a bunch more stuff to learn for an entire DevOps pipeline.

As I learn more about Hub and Kraken, I guess my next goal is working on making a functional Discord bot.
Javascript I believe is what the official API uses, so I'll use that or TypeScript.

Hamba kahle.
