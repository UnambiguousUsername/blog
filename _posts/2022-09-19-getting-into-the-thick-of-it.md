Finally onto the section in Discord.js where I learn a little bit more about the slash commands and how to interact and respond with them.
Sadly, it seems like there is disjoint between the code I have followed thus far and the code I'm now reviewing in the guide.
The current parts of the guide are using awaits instead of returns, and as of now I'm now entirely sure if I can just replace my returns with multiple awaits in each command.
This is going to take some testing, investigating, and some investigating if I can't figure it out in 5-10 minutes.

I look forward to bringing cool little features to this bot.
Also need to look into what database tech I should use.

- Peace out
