So much for me doing this everyday eh?

But I did make good progress thus far today! I was able to complete the Slash Command section of the guide.
Getting slightly more familiar with the way JS/Node run things around here.

There is actually a lot more of the guide than I thought, since there are component builder sections, a whole FAQ, and more!
My bot will be able to do everything!

- Until we meet again
